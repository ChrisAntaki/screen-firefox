Clear Screen Identifiers, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-clear-screen-iden/)

Note: Flash leaks screen identifiers too. To fully defend these identifiers, as well as a ton of others Flash exposes, you must install Flashblock, or entirely disabled Flash. Sorry Adobe...
