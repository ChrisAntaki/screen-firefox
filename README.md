Clear Screen Identifiers, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-clear-screen-iden/)

Note: Flashblock must also be installed, as Flash leaks screen indentifiers, amongst many others like fonts. You could also just disable Flash, of course. :)
