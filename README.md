Clear Screen Identifiers, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-clear-screen-iden/)

Note: Flash must also be disabled, as it leaks screen identifiers (amongst **many others**). Flashblock works great, as it still allows you to view Flash on pages you trust.
